**Air Gesture Control (Version 3)**

This project represents the final iteration of the hand gesture control system, incorporating the best features of Versions 1 and 2 while enhancing overall performance and user experience.

**Key Features:**

* **Combined Functionalities:** Includes volume, brightness, and mouse control capabilities.
* **Optimized Performance:** Streamlined code for efficient execution and resource utilization.
* **Refactored Structure:** Improved code organization for better maintainability.
* **Enhanced Gesture Recognition:** Refined hand gesture detection for increased accuracy and responsiveness.

**File Structure:**

* **HandDetection.py:** Contains functions for hand detection and tracking.
* **Mousecontrol.py:** Handles mouse movement and click actions based on hand gestures.
* **Readme.txt:** Provides project overview, installation instructions, and usage information.
* **requirements.txt:** Lists the necessary Python libraries.

**Requirements:**

* Python 3.x
* OpenCV library
* MediaPipe library
* AutoPy library
* PyCaw library
* win10toast library

**Installation:**

1. Install Python 3.x from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Open a terminal window and navigate to your project directory.
3. Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe autopy pycaw win10toast
```

**Running the Script:**

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to your project directory.
2. Run the main script (e.g., `main.py` or `Air_Gesture_Final.py`):

```bash
python main.py
```
or
```bash
python Air_Gesture_Final.py
```

**Note:** Replace `main.py` or `Air_Gesture_Final.py` with the actual name of your main script file.

By combining the strengths of previous versions and addressing identified limitations, Version 3 offers a robust and versatile hand gesture control solution.
