## Air Gesture Control

### Overview
This project aims to develop a system that enables users to control their computer's functions, including volume, brightness, and mouse movement, using hand gestures. It utilizes computer vision techniques to track hand movements and map them to corresponding system actions.

### Project Structure
The project consists of three main versions, each building upon the previous one:

* **Version 1:** Focuses on basic volume and brightness control.
* **Version 2:** Introduces mouse control functionalities.
* **Version 3:** Combines and optimizes features from Versions 1 and 2.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/air-gesture-control.git

   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate  # Activate on Windows
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage
